# You can download the job files by clicking the "Download Job" button above. You'll then need to place

# # Solving the Maximal Independent Set Problem on defective King Graph
# ## Introduction
# In this tutorial, we show how to use some of Bloqade's built-in tools to generate a
# defects in a graph and then use Bloqade to solve the Maximal Independent Set (MIS)
# problem on a Unit Disk Graph (UDG), which is easily expressable on Neutral Atom
# Hardware via the Rydberg blockade mechanism. We will not cover hybrid quantum-
# classical algorithms in this tutorial, but instead, we will use a simple parameter
# scan to find the optimal detuning value for an adiabatic ramp. We will cover hybrid
# quantum-classical algorithms in a future tutorial.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Define the Program.
# To define random defects on any Bloqade geometry, simply call the `add_defect_density`
# or `add_defect_count` methods on the geometry object. The `add_defect_density` method
# takes a float between 0 and 1 and uses that as the probability of a site being a
# defect. The `add_defect_count` method takes the number of defects to add to the
# geometry placed in random locations. Both ways take an  optional `rng` argument,
# a numpy random number generator. If no `rng` argument is provided, then the default
# numpy random number generator is used. Using the random number generator allows you
# to set the seed for reproducibility. After that, defining the pulse sequence is the
# same as in the previous tutorials.

# ## Plot Results
# Here, the total number of Rydberg excitations is plotted as a function of the final
# detuning. The total number of Rydberg excitations is a proxy for the largest
# independent set size because the number of violations to the Rydberg blockade is and
# will not scale with the size of the independent set. We start by loading the results

# The report object already has a method to calculate the Rydberg densities. We can
# use this to calculate the average total Rydberg density for each final detuning.
# then, we can plot the results.
